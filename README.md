# NeoVim-IDE
## Introduction:
I started using Neovimi a while ago, and I love it. The feel and the typing experience of Neovimi are great, but starting from zero can be rough. It is better to have a starting point, and for me, I found two things.
  1. NeoVim Simple Configuration Files
  2. Chad-NeoVim

Both are the config files of Neovim, but they are different.

## Chad-NeoVim:
Chad-NeoVim are the config files of NeoVim for a full-stack IDE; an IDE is a developing environment for programming, and you use these config files for developing multiple applications.

## Sample config:
These are more like my own configuration files, geared mainly towards writing blogs and Markdown; you can code, but it's not well suited.


## File Finding:
So for this, if you want to check out these files, the backup file will be the simple one, and the default one will be the Chad-NeoVim Conf files.


## Theme:
By default, the theme for this neovim is "Tokyo Night Theme", You change the theme in the config files of neovim.
